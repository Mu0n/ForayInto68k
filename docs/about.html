<b>About this website:</b> I'm making this website as a way to jot down notes on my System 6, black and white, Macintosh game programming hobby (in C). It might sound futile and odd to many to be so specialized on retroprogramming, but it's easily justifiable on the grounds of nostalgia. I used a Macintosh Plus between 1985-6 to the early 90's and therefore it is the platform that defined the computing aspect of my youth. I've always wondered how you could write games for it. I did use MS Basic 2.0 in that time, but I always felt the constraints of the MS Basic environment to be very limiting, first because you needed to run the Basic application before running your stuff, and second, because it's a slow and doesn't do well in the animation department.
<p>So here I am, nearly two decades after my first steps on that wonderfully concise and elegant platform. I've migrated to the PC a long time ago, but still have the old Mac Plus working. Also, very good emulators have been written for both modern Mac computers and PC. I've made a <a href=./emulation.html>small section</a> with information on them. My goal is not to make a website on emulation, as you can find that elsewhere on the web.
<p>
Hopefully, there is a pocket of nostalgia-laden people out there who would share the same hobby, and could actually collaborate with me in understanding the platform, and designing games with me. Failing that, this website will remain as long as I can afford to maintain it and might spark interest at a later date, after I've lost interest in it (which in all probability will happen someday). Feel free to give out comments, offers or ask questions <a href=mailto:micjuneau@hotmail.com>here</a>.
