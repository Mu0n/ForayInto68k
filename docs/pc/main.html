MS-DOS executable with source code: <a href=/pc/ga2.zip>ga2.zip</a><br>

In order to compile this piece of DOS code, you need the <a href=http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/allegro/>Allegro game library</a> and an allegro-friendly compiler, such as the free <a href=http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/>DJGPP C compiler</a>.
<p>
<b>Controls:</b>
Blue player- <br>
Movement: arrows<br>
Shoot: left control<br>
<p>
Red player- <br>
Movement: joystick axes<br>
Shoot: firs joystick button<br>
<p>
General controls: resume action after a point is made: R<br>
Quit: ESC<br>
<p>
Joystick support used to work when I had Windows 98SE. Under WinXP, it doesn't seem to work. You might have better luck with me with the newest Allegro version. There is no interface whatsoever in the game, it was just a study of sprite movement/animation, bullet limitations (each player can have at most 3 bullets on screen at any time) and simple game mechanics in general.
