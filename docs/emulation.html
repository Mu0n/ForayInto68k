1) vMac and <a href=http://minivmac.sourceforge.net/>mini vMac</a> - Those are Mac Plus (68k compact macs) emulators. They will run up to System 7.5, I believe. On the PC, mini-vMac <b>finally</b> supports sound, better than vMac even (since v2.4.1). The main difference between the 2 is that mini-vmac was made as an effort to greatly simplify the code of vMac, and therefore has slightly less features, and is a bit slower.<p>
2) Basilisk II <a href="https://www.emaculation.com/doku.php/basilisk_ii">Basilisk II page on Emaculation</a> (PC, MacOS and Linux) Basilisk II is a color 68k mac emulator that can run Mac OS 7.0 up to 8.1. There are several different versions, depending on the platform, and there are variations in the support for ROM images of macs. You can mount a local machine's hard disk in order to easily transfer properly archived file (so as to not lose your files' resource forks inside a modern OS), making HFVExplorer almost obsolete. Older version offered as a direct download for PC <a href=./files/bii.zip>here</a><p>
3) <a href=https://www.emaculation.com/doku.php/hfvexplorer>HFVExplorer</a> (pc only) - this nifty program allows someone to create, manage, copy files to and from, virtual Mac HFV (hierarchical file volume) disks. A PC user should know that each Mac file has 2 forks - a data and resource one. You should expect an uncompressed file to have both. Transfers of such files to a PC destroys the resource fork. Therefore, you should try to get things compressed as .sit, .hqx, .bin, .cpt, .img, .image, since those only carry a data fork. Otherwise, you need to transfer it on a mac first.<p>
4) <a href="https://bluescsi.onegeekarmy.eu/diskjockey/">Disk Jockey</a> (mac only) - this program allows you to create HDA files, which include a SCSI hard disk driver, necessary if you  want to use this volume on a device like a BlueSCSI or RaSCSI on a real machine. Those volumes will also work on Basilisk II as-is, but may not work in mini-vMac (asks for a format).
<p>
All requests for ROM files (which are needed to run these emulators) will be ignored.
