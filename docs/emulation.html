1) vMac and <a href=http://minivmac.sourceforge.net/>mini vMac</a> - Those are Mac Plus (68k compact macs) emulators. They will run up to System 7.5, I believe. On the PC, mini-vMac <b>finally</b> supports sound, better than vMac even (since v2.4.1). The main difference between the 2 is that mini-vmac was made as an effort to greatly simplify the code of vMac, and therefore has slightly less features, and is a bit slower.<p>
2) Basilisk II <a href=/files/bii.zip>(pc)</a> <a href=http://basilisk.cebix.net/>(mac)</a> Basilisk is a color 68k mac emulator that can run Mac OS 7.0 up to 8.1. There are several different versions, depending on the platform, and there are variations in the support for ROM images of macs. The latest PC version, v0.8, cannot run classic emulation (i.e. a Mac Plus ROM). One neat feature is that on a PC, for example, you can connect on the net with either a modem or a network card (cable modem, ISDN or the like), giving someone who is mac-less the opportunity to log on the net in a mac environment and giving one the ability to transfer files without worrying about corruption for non-compressed files.<p>
3) <a href=http://www.download.de/downloads/d_beitrag_8790990.html?tid1=15359&tid2=17640>HFVExplorer</a> (pc only) - this nifty program allows someone to create, manage, copy files to and from, virtual Mac HFV (hierarchical file volume) disks. A PC user should know that each Mac file has 2 forks - a data and resource one. You should expect an uncompressed file to have both. Transfers of such files to a PC destroys the resource fork. Therefore, you should try to get things compressed as .sit, .hqx, .bin, .cpt, .img, .image, since those only carry a data fork. Otherwise, you need to transfer it on a mac first.
<p>
All requests for ROM files (which are needed to run these emulators) will be ignored.
