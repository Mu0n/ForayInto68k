<p>
A utility (<a href=/4instr/index.shtml>4instr</a>) that can edit the wavetables of the 4-tone synthesizer which can be used by the old Sound Driver (as opposed to the Sound Manager, which was introduced with System 6.0.3 and was later standard in the late 80's macs). This program will make sound for Macs such as the Mac Plus and earlier, Mac SE, Mac SE/30, Powerbook 180, among others. New version, the day after: save+load functionality added.<br>
