/* There you have it. Wasn't that bad, was it? These commands initialize a 
series of macintosh managers. Note that you could skip a few of those, without 
much serious adverse effect. However, if you skip the InitCursor function, 
your cursor will get stuck as a watch cursor for the duration of your program. 

Also, the GetDateTime is used to give the random function a different value each 
time you run your program, since it will depend on the date and time that 
program is run. Now, since that program doesn't do anything at all, much less 
try to calculate random values anywhere, it won't do much good *here*. But, 
should you use the Random() function of the toolbox, you'll get non-monotonous 
results each time. */
