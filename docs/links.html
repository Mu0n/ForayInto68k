<b>comp.sys.mac.programmer.help</b>: <a href=http://groups.google.com/group/comp.sys.mac.programmer.help?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8>(link)</a> a fairly active mailing list for Mac programmers of all trades, mostly for OSX programmers. However, there is a small core of old-seasoned veterans that still could answer many questions about the old stuff, because they used to work on it too! Also useful to get answers about the general mac programming topics.

<b>Inside Macintosh (online version)</b>: <a href=http://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos8/mac8.html>(link)</a> Click on the relevant topic that you want to check out to see a choice between "up-to-date" API (which is certainly too recent for Mac Plus programming needs) and the Inside Macintosh link (which *might* be too recent). To make sure you get Mac Plus related, compatible information, use the older Inside Macintosh in book form (80's editions), or use the excellent THINK Reference program that comes with Symantec C++ v6 or v7.

<b>Mactech</b>: <a href=http://www.mactech.com/>(link)</a>. Mactech has an extensive <a href=http://www.mactech.com/articles/>article archive</a> of programming articles and question/answers letters from the readers that go all the way back to 1985. A given article might cover one of these languages: C, Pascal, assembly, Lisp, etc. Truly an awesome place to find specific tricks of programming these old machines. I use google to search for a specific programming topic, like "sound driver" along with "mactech" so that I can quickly find a relevant result.

<b>System 6 Heaven</b>: <a href=http://www.euronet.nl/users/mvdk/system_6_heaven.html>(link)</a>. Everything you need to know or get to make the most out of your system 6 mac.

<b>University of Michigan ftp</b>: <a href=http://www.umich.edu/~archive/mac/>(link)</a>. A good bundle of source codes in the development section. Contains lots of other things, like games, graphic apps, hypercard stacks, sounds, etc.
